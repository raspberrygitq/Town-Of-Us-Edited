# Role List Settings
The Role List dictates what roles will spawn in game.\
However many players there are in a game, will dictate the last slot used,\
for example, if there are 9 players, only the first 9 slots will be used.\
Common buckets, only take in roles which are not a killing/power role in that faction.\
Auto adjustments will be made if there are not enough crewmates or impostors to make a more balanced game.
